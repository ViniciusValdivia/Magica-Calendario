# The Magic
Considering the calendars above, in which one is your birthday underlined?

With your yes or no answer to each of the calendars it is possible to determine your birthday using some mathematical rules.

Check out how this is possible by the code I wrote to perform the magic.

# Project description
This magic was taken from the book: 'Mágicas, Matemática e outros mistérios', written by João Carlos Vieira Sampaio and 
Pedro Luiz Aparecido Malagutti, professors at UFSCAR(Federal University of São Carlos).

![CAPA LIVRO](https://github.com/ViniciusValdivia/Magica-Calendario/blob/main/LIVRO%20M%C3%81GICA.png)

The subject of mathematics involved in magic is the binary number system.

For this project I present three codes in Python so that the computer can perform the magic: the first code provides a basic understanding of
what is happening with the calendars and the underlined days. 
When I applied this magic with high school students, those who decided to crack it were able to conceptualize this rule, but 
without really knowing why this technique worked.

The second code uses the remainders of divisions by powers of 2 (binary numbers behind the scenes). This was the first of the three codes I created; 
at the beginning of my studies with little knowledge I was able to elaborate the code with only basic mathematical operations.

And in the third code the idea is to use the transformation of decimal numbers to binary and vice versa.


# Conclusion
Carrying out the project so far is rewarding and even stimulating to improve and deepen this study.

I believe that it is possible to elaborate an even more economical code in its writing, using mathematical ideas.

I still intend to extend the project to the area of ​​data science and present interesting statistical results for those who participated in the magic.

Do you know the birthday paradox?
