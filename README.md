# The Magic
Considering the calendars above, in which one is your birthday underlined?

With your yes or no answer to each of the calendars it is possible to determine your birthday using some mathematical rules.

Check out how this is possible by the code I wrote to perform the magic.

# Project description
This magic was taken from the book: 'Mágicas, Matemática e outros mistérios', written by João Carlos Vieira Sampaio and Pedro Luiz Aparecido Malagutti, professors at UFSCAR(Federal University of São Carlos).

The subject of mathematics involved in magic is the binary number system.

I present two codes in Python so that the machine can perform the magic: the first code uses the remainders of divisions by powers of 2 (binary numbers behind the scenes).

In the second code the idea is to use the transformation of decimal numbers to binary and vice versa.

It is still possible to find out the month of birth by asking about the sign.
